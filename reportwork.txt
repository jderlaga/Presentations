Timeline:

Papers:

TE adaptation
  Equidistribution principle... on hold until dual solver are up and running, 
  can write intro, lit review sections

Entropy Adjoint
  For certain cases, the exact entropy is known, 
  as is TE (1D Burgers... Q1D nozzle needs TE terms, or substitute in exact soln to discrete eq's)

Hessian TR
  Need:
  Help with different unstructured grids (see below)
  Formulate hybrid Green/LSQ (interior/exterior) method

Code:
  Want:
  to unify the simple codes into one-stop-shops for specific tasks
  a good example for all future work with SENSEI

  Have:
  3D Jacobians for van Leer and Roe fluxes
  a tested tridiagonal solver
  explicit Q1D-nozzle (Q1D) and 1D Burgers' Eq codes

1st week July
  Need to better understand autotools and library creation
  Make autotools builds for Q1D and 1DB
    Once one example is in place, all others will be easy

2nd week July
  Create primal implicit solver for Q1D, debug and test
  Create primal implicit solver for 1DB, debug and test
    Make sure these run back at VT w/o problems

3rd week July
  Create dual solvers for Q1D and 1DB, debug and test
  Plenty of literature to compare Q1D dual solutions to, and already have continuous dual 1DB code

4th week July
  Wrap up dual solver debug, make interface with Aniruddha's 1D adaptation mechanics
  Work on error estimation methods
    ( dual solver just a dual solver w/ separate adaptation parameter code? )

1st week August
  Start some adjoint based adaptation test cases

2nd week August
  'Odds and ends' aka, wedding week



Turb modeling stuff ( daily, running in the background )

  Mostly done with CFL3D SA, need to run a few of the finer cases farther
  Should have .nmf files for FUN3D done during 1st week July

  Need:
  Talk to C. Rumsey about CFL3D post processing
  Once SA done, do SST

Papers to write:

**** Hessian writeup:****
Need to sort sources, currently jumbled between many, many folders. 
Identify review papers vs. original source material.

Many researchers say one method is optimal vs. another... appears to be 
mesh dependent.

Convergence properties... should a method be convergent?  
LSQ of LSQ should be second order, but variational is zeroth(?) order as it is
mesh quality dependent.

Need mixed type grids... already have right angle tet grids, need:
Mixed AR Right Angle Tet
Equilateral Tet
Isoceles Tet

**** Burgers' Eq. Adjoint ****
Two parts to this, entropy and TE terms

What happens when entropy is used to flag adaptation?
Compare to DE and TE distributions.

TE terms for adaptation, what does that mean for adjoint?
R adapation only on nodes/cells flagged for adaptation?

Presentations to make:
**** VT Semester Survey ****
Code base changes to SENSEI
Unit Testing
Code Profiling

Continuous Adjoint
Adjoint error estimation and TE
Burgers' Eq

TE terms and grid stretching

**** Code Profiling ****
GPROF Tutorial for VT
